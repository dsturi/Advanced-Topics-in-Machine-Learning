Advanced Topics in Machine Learning - Assignments & Final Project
Welcome to the repository for my Advanced Topics in Machine Learning class. This repository contains all six assignments and the final project, which focuses on a Malaria detection algorithm.

Repository Structure
Assignment 1 - 6: Each assignment folder contains code, data, and results for the respective topics covered in the course.
Final Project: A machine learning algorithm to classify Malaria images as Parasitized or Uninfected using deep learning techniques.
Assignments Overview

Assignment 1: Linear and Logistic Regression.

Assignment 2: From Scratch Models: Single neuron Regression and classification.

Assignment 3: Vanishing Gradients.

Assignment 4: Exercise in training, saving, and reusing a model.

Assignment 5: ResNet and other model architectures.

Assignment 6: Time Series Analysis.

Final Project: Malaria Detection
Objective: Develop a deep learning model to classify images as Parasitized or Uninfected based on Malaria cell image data.
Dataset: The dataset consists of thousands of images labeled as either Parasitized or Uninfected.
Approach:
Data preprocessing and augmentation
Model selection and training using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
Evaluation and performance metrics
Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, and Python
